CSS: arranging elements with Flexbox and Grid

Here I related flexbox with already known ways of positioning elements;
I also saw flexbox and its properties for positioning elements;
I produced the header using the flexbox tools;
I identified the limitations of flexbox.
I differentiated the flexbox from the grid prototype the layout of a card using basic grid properties;
Recognize in the figma layout what can be part of a grid;
I associated the new properties with what already exists in the project's structure;
I've seen how the current layout behaves on a different device; Furthermore, solved the problems with new grid properties;
I produced the rest of the layout with new grid properties;
I identified problems such as: code repetition, maintenance and measurement units;
I understood the advantages of using the grid approach; Finally, I planned how to build the other pages of the project using the techniques learned.
